The Punta Aderci promontory characterizes the entire area, offering a 360° view of the entire Reserve, with the backdrop of the mountain profiles of the three national parks. It's an ideal place for walks, mountain bike excursions on the old railway track, or canoeing, where it's possible to spot dolphins and admire the Halymenia floresia, considered the most beautiful red algae in the Mediterranean.

Structured as a large balcony, on one side it has a sequence of wall-houses that rarely open into narrow alleys, on the other side walls and railings that delimit the road with views of green slopes and beyond to the blue sea.

  description: Vasto's historic center is a gem to explore, with its narrow alleys and ancient buildings. The Cathedral of San Giuseppe, with its simple Romanesque façade, is an important landmark. The interior, originally Baroque, was reworked in Neo-Gothic style in 1853. The ceiling is geometric and flat, with green-striped supporting columns and Corinthian capitals. The altar is raised and accessible by stairs, with a modern organ towering behind, illuminated by the rose window on the façade. The cathedral was elevated to this rank in 1853 and in 1986 became a co-cathedral.
